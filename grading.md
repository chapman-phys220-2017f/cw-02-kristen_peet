# Instructor comments

1. Be careful when committing files to GitHub. You have lots of extraneous hidden ("dot") files you don't need. Commit only the key files you want the world to look at.
1. See comments inline about input() vs. command line arguments.
1. When putting together a notebook, import your code as modules. Do not copy and paste large blocks of code. Also, remember that you can have subheadings using multiple hash marks, to help organize sections.
